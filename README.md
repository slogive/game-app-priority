# Game/App Priority

Grant the priority of your game/app to high even if you can&apos;t change the permissions from your task manager.
<br />
<br />
This is useful to assign more resources from your computer to the game/app.
<br />
<br />
Easy Anti-Cheat blocks the possible changes through the task manager and that code from below can bypass it.

<u>Avoid add apps do not exist</u> \*\*

<b>Enjoy it.</b>
